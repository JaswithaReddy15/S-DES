# S-DES
<h3> The Simplifies Data Encryption Standard was developed by Professor Edward Schaefer of Santa Clara University for educational purposes.</h3><br>
Link to the paper describing the algorithm: http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/COSC%205130/G-SDES.pdf
<br>
This respository consists of three programs that implement the S-DES algorithm.<br>
1. Key Generation <br>
2. Encryption <br>
3. Decryption

Please let me know if there're any errors so I can learn too.
